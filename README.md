# FarmStore
FarmStore is a command-line based Java application simulating a simple farm store system. It offers a basic but functional interface for both administrators and customers. The project focuses on core Java concepts like OOP, data handling, and control flow.

The Admin Panel allows administrators to manage the inventory by adding, updating, or removing farm products. Admins can also view purchase logs to monitor customer activity and sales history.

The Customer Interface enables users to browse available products, make purchases, and view their purchase history. All actions are performed through a simple CLI menu system, ensuring smooth user interaction without a graphical interface.

FarmStore is built entirely in Java and designed to strengthen understanding of backend application structure and console-based UI design. It demonstrates the logic of a real-world store operation while maintaining clarity and modularity in code.
